<h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 ½ pounds beef chuck roast (should be very well-marbled)</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons barbecue dry rub </li>
        <li>½ cup Kansas City style BBQ sauce</li>
        <li>4 sandwich or hoagie rolls</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) container cheese whiz, or sliced cheese as needed</li>
        <li> ⅔ cup sautéed onions</li>
        <li> ⅔ cup chopped jarred pickled peppers</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons sliced green onions </li>        
    </ul>
<h3> Directions </h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients, and preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Season beef with dry rub, and double wrap in foil. Place on a sheet pan or in a baking dish, seam side up, and roast in the preheated oven for 2 1/2 hours.

        </li>
        <li>Let rest for 1 hour. Unwrap and transfer to a cutting board. Reserve all juices. Cut into 1-inch cubes and transfer to a mixing bowl. Add cooking juices, more dry rub if desired, and bbq sauce. Mix well, wrap, and refrigerate overnight.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Transfer beef into a shallow baking dish and brush generously with bbq sauce.

        </li>
        <li>Roast in the preheated oven until meat starts to char around the edges, about 1 hour. Remove from oven and brush again with bbq sauce. Reduce oven temperature to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Roast until the "burnt ends" are as tender as you want, about 1 1/2 hours more.</li>
        <li>Transfer the "burnt ends" onto the rolls, and finish with cheese whiz, onions, peppers, and green onions.

        </li>
        <li>Serve and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
